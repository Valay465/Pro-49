Shikhar Dhawan (born 5 December 1985) is 
an Indian international cricketer. 
A left-handed opening batsman and an 
occasional right-arm off break bowler, 
he plays for Delhi in first-class cricket and 
Delhi Capitals in the IPL. 
He played for the Indian Under-17 and 
Under-19 teams before making his 
first-class debut for Delhi in November 2004. 
At the 2015 World Cup, Dhawan was 
the leading run-scorer for India 
and in the following year, became the 
fastest Indian to reach 3,000 ODI runs. 
In December 2017, he became the 2nd 
fastest Indian to reach 4000 ODI runs. 
Dhawan also holds the record for most

ICC Tournaments.
Dhawan made his One Day International

Visakhapatnam. His Test debut came against 
the same opposition in March 2013 at Mohali 
where he scored the fastest century by any 
batsman on Test debut and ended his innings 
with 187 runs from 174 balls. A prolific 
run-scorer in ICC tournaments, Dhawan 
top-scored in the 2004 Under-19 World Cup,
